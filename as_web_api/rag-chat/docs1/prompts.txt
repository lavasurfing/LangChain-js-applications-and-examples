Purpose: Define prompt templates.

- `SYSTEM_TEMPLATE`: Instructs the model to answer using only provided context and history.
- `answerPrompt`: Combines system message, `history`, and a human message to answer.
- `condenseQuestionPrompt`: Rewrites the latest user question into a standalone question using history.

These templates are used in the RAG chain to ensure responses are grounded and context-aware.
