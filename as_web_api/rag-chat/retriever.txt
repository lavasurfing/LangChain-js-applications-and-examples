Purpose: Build a retriever from PDFs.

- Splits documents using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` (chunkSize=1000, overlap=200).
- Embeds chunks with `embeddings` and stores them in `MemoryVectorStore`.
- Returns a retriever interface for semantic search.

Exports:
- `buildRetriever()`: constructs and returns a retriever for queries.
- `retrieveContext(question)`: convenience that fetches relevant docs and joins their text.
